# Cottonbro

This will enable users(creators) create merch. This ranges from shirts, beenies, sweatshirts, croptops etc. A user can then choose to download this merch. They can publish a link(private or public) which then other users can purchase. I want a canva like app where they can edit assets that will go on the clothes, user can then see a 3d like image of someone wearing the shirt in a given size before checking it out. We handle printing, sales & delivery.
